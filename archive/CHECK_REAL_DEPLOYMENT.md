# URGENT: CHECK REAL DEPLOYMENT STATUS

## THE REAL PROBLEM FOUND:

Your store is loading script from **VERCEL** (which requires auth) instead of my deployed **SUPABASE** function.

From your logs: `popup-script.js?shop=testingstoresumeet.myshopify.com`

This suggests the script is coming from:
- ❌ Vercel: `smartpop-revenue-engine-qroi6yejy-sumeets-projects-09b827d6.vercel.app/popup-script.js` (BLOCKED - requires auth)
- ✅ Should be: `zsmoutzjhqjgjehaituw.supabase.co/functions/v1/popup-embed-public` (WORKING)

## URGENT STEPS TO FIX:

### 1. Find what's injecting the Vercel script
You need to check what's actually deployed on your Shopify store:

**Method A - Shopify Admin:**
1. Go to: https://testingstoresumeet.myshopify.com/admin/settings/apps
2. Look for script tags or installed apps
3. Find what's pointing to Vercel

**Method B - Theme Files:**
1. Go to: https://testingstoresumeet.myshopify.com/admin/themes
2. Edit code → Check theme.liquid
3. Look for any script tags with `smartpop` or `popup`

### 2. Replace with working script
Replace any references to:
```
smartpop-revenue-engine-qroi6yejy-sumeets-projects-09b827d6.vercel.app
```

With:
```
https://zsmoutzjhqjgjehaituw.supabase.co/functions/v1/popup-embed-public?shop=testingstoresumeet.myshopify.com
```

### 3. Quick Test
You can test immediately by running this in console on your store:

**On customer store:**
```javascript
// Remove old broken script
const oldScripts = document.querySelectorAll('script[src*="vercel.app"], script[src*="popup-script.js"]');
oldScripts.forEach(s => s.remove());

// Add working script
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'https://zsmoutzjhqjgjehaituw.supabase.co/functions/v1/popup-embed-public?shop=testingstoresumeet.myshopify.com&debug=true';
script.async = true;
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

**Expected result:** Popups should appear after 2 seconds

## VERIFICATION:

✅ **My functions ARE deployed and working:**
- popup-embed-public: ✅ Working
- popup-config API: ✅ Working (7 active popups found)

❌ **Your store is loading from wrong source:**
- Vercel app requires authentication
- Store can't access the script
- Using old broken endpoint

## THE FIX:

Find where the Vercel script reference is in your Shopify store and replace it with the working Supabase function URL.

This is NOT a code problem - this is a deployment configuration problem.
