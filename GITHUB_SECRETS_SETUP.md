# 🔐 GitHub Secrets Setup for Full CI/CD

## Current Status
✅ **Basic Pipeline**: Build + Test (WORKING)
⚠️ **Full Deployment**: Requires secrets setup

## Required GitHub Secrets

To enable full automated deployment, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

### 🔧 Supabase Secrets
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
2. Create new token
3. Add to GitHub repo secrets:
   - `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` = your_access_token

### 🚀 Vercel Secrets  
1. Go to https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. Create new token
3. Get your org/project IDs:
   ```bash
   npx vercel org list
   npx vercel project list
   ```
4. Add to GitHub repo secrets:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN` = your_token
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID` = your_org_id  
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` = your_project_id

## How to Add Secrets

1. **Go to Repository**: https://github.com/sum-eet/smartpop-revenue-engine
2. **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. **New repository secret**
4. Add each secret above

## Current Pipeline Features

### ✅ What Works Now:
- Build verification
- Dependency installation
- Current deployment testing
- Admin detection verification

### 🚀 What Full Secrets Enable:
- Automatic Supabase deployment
- Automatic Vercel deployment  
- Full post-deployment verification
- Zero-touch deployment pipeline

## Manual Deployment (Always Available)

Even without secrets, you can deploy manually:

```bash
# Full deployment
npm run deploy

# Individual services  
npm run deploy:supabase
npm run deploy:vercel

# Test current deployment
npm run verify:deployment
```

## Pipeline Trigger

Every push to main triggers:
1. ✅ Build test
2. ✅ Current deployment verification
3. ⚠️ Deployment (if secrets configured)

## Next Steps

1. **Add secrets** for full automation
2. **Or continue manual deployment** (works perfectly)
3. **Pipeline protects against** admin detection breaking

The current pipeline ensures admin detection is always verified!
